class Codec(ABC):
    """
    Base class for all codecs.

    A codec is responsible for compressing and decompressing arrays. It knows
    how to turn a dense NumPy array into a :class:`CompressedPayload` and back,
    and how to (de)serialize that payload to/from an HDF5 file.

    Subclasses are auto-registered by name on class creation. This allows
    the reader to automatically recognize and use the appropriate codec by name,
    without having to import every codec.

    Most codecs do not support random access writes and algorithms can be
    inefficient at performing many small writes, so writes to the payload are
    buffered until max_pending_writes is reached. Once this value is exceeded,
    the entire array will be decompressed, the writes applied, and the
    array recompressed. By default, this value is set to 10,000.

    If a codec supports random access writes efficiently, it should
    implement the :meth:`partial_write` method. If this method is
    implemented, it will always be immediately used for applying writes,
    bypassing max_pending_writes entirely.
